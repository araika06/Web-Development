        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
        
        <p>I would see scenes like the breathtaking landscapes of Hawaii, from the golden beaches of Waikiki to the lush rainforests and active volcanoes of the Big Island. </p>

        <p>And animals like shark through the ocean, colorful tropical fish in coral reefs, and humpback whales breaching in the warm Hawaiian waters.</p>
